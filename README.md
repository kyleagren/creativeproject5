# kyleagren.github.io for the original

I originally made this as part of an application to an on campus job. 

I opted to tweak it and try to re-use it for something related to this class since I did work on it during this semester. 

I did not spend a full 10 hours on this, I will admit. But I think I work slightly faster than the average person so I also don't feel super bad about it. 

I considered fully rewriting it in React but after reading the requirements I didn't actually think it would be necessary.
